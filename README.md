# py-blockchain
I finally started with the development of a blockchain. It's my first attempt. There is a lot to do. I've described the phases I've completed and the phases which are pending. Once the project is completed, I'll also release a blog post for the same on MEDIUM.

## Phases
~~ Create a Chain of Data ~~
~~ Mine Blocks ~~
~~ Block Hashing ~~
~~ Analyze and Verify the Chain ~~
~~ Perform Transactions ~~
* Store Chain to Disk
* Create a Node Network
* Share the data and Resolve conflicts
* Create a Wallet

## Technologies Used
* Python
* Flask (to be used)
* Node.js (to be used)

## Status
In progress
