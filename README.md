# py-blockchain
I've got a keen interest in Blockchain and Cryptocurrency and believe that it has what it takes to revolutionize a lot of things and create viable solutions for many problems. Although,
blockchain shouldn't be just used just because it sounds cool, or it's in trend, infact it should be used only if its appliable in a product or scenario.

This is my first attempt at coding a blockchain with basic functionality, once completed, I'll write a blog post for the same on my Medium profile. 

## Phases
